Alongside supervising the Human Rights Council in Geneva, OHCHR primarily focuses on promoting human rights without distinction as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. OHCHR ensures the protection of human rights under severe circumstances of violence, conflict and insecurity.
