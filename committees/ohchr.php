		<h3>Committee Description</h3>
        <p>
			Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) was established on 20 December 1993 and it continues to work as the principal human rights office of the UN in compliance with the international human rights treaties and the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Alongside supervising the Human Rights Council in Geneva, OHCHR primarily focuses on promoting human rights without distinction as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. OHCHR ensures the protection of human rights under severe circumstances of violence, conflict and insecurity.
			<br><br>
			OHCHR’s Regional Office for Central Asia (ROCA) was established in 2008 in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan and currently covers four of five countries in the region: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. The main purpose of this office is to engage with Governments, intergovernmental organizations, civil society, the private sector as well as relevant United Nations partners, to formulate and implement strategies, programmes and measures for the promotion and protection of all human rights in the countries of Central Asia.
			<br><br>
			OHCHR’s Regional Office for Europe is mandated to promote and protect human rights in EU Member States, the candidate and potential candidate countries of the Balkans, as well as Iceland, Norway and Turkey. Through the integration of the UN’s human rights standards into EU-wide policies, legislation and implementation measures, the Regional Office aims to help address human rights challenges in Europe. It also seeks to ensure the integration of the UN’s human rights perspective in external EU policies and activities.
