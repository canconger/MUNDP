		<h3>Committee Description</h3>
        <p>
			The United Nations Higher Commission for Refugees was established in 1950 with the intention of helping the millions of European refugees who had fled their homes as a result of the Second World War. It works on the basis of the basic human right to seek asylum. The main goal of UNHCR is to provide safe refuge for ones who have fled violence, war, persecution or disaster at home; its directive has expanded over the years to ensure the protection of all displaced persons, including those who are internally displaced.
			<br><br>
      Africa hosts 18 million refugees which make up more than 26 percent of the world’s refugee population, due to ongoing crises in South Sudan, Nigeria, and the Central African Republic (CAR) in addition to various conflicts in Yemen and Burundi. UNHCR works towards ensuring that displaced persons have access to services such as education and healthcare across Africa. It helps create safe school environments, improve security in refugee camps, and provide lighting in public spaces to decrease the risks of sexual and gender based violence.
