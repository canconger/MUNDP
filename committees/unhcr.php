		<h3>Committee Description</h3>
        <p>
			The United Nations Higher Commission for Refugees was established in 1950 with the intention of helping the millions of European refugees who had fled their homes as a result of the Second World War. It works on the basis of the basic human right to seek asylum. The main goal of UNHCR is to provide a safe refuge for ones who have fled violence, war, persecution or disaster at home; its directive has expanded over the years to ensure the protection of all displaced persons, including those who are internally displaced.
			<br><br>
      An estimated %40 percent of the world's refugees are either in or from the Middle East, even though the region holds only %5 of the global population. Civil wars in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Libya have forced millions of people to be internally displaced in the region, with just as much seeking asylum in other continents and regions. This leaves millions of families in need of assistance, and UNHCR aims to deliver aid in forms of food, shelter, education, and navigation.
