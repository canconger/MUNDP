		<h3>Committee Description</h3>
        <p>
			The United Nations Higher Commission for Refugees was established in 1950 with the intention of helping the millions of European refugees who had fled their homes as a result of the second world war. It works on the basis of the basic human right to seek asylum. The main goal is to provide safe refuge for ones who have fled violence, war, persecution or disaster at home. UNHCRs directive has expanded over the years to ensure the protection of all displaced persons, including those who are internally displaced.
			<br><br>
			Due to the instability in the middle east, up to a million refugees seek asylum in Europe per year. In 2015 IOM estimated that 1,011,700 refugees arrived in Europe by sea, along with the 34,900 which arrived by land. Due to poor conditions and overcrowding, about 4,000 of these refugees were reported drowning in the Mediterranean. It is essential that these conditions which are causing such tragedies are monitored, and controlled as well as the refugees.
