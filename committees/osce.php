		<h3>Committee Description</h3>
        <p>
			The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe or OSCE was established in 1973 by the European countries at the height of the cold war as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). It was a remarkable attempt at the time which brought the two sides together and achieved de-escalation . After the dissolution of the Soviet Union the organisation’s role drastically changed, and the CSCE was transformed into OSCE by a decision made at the Budapest Summit. The organisation currently has 57 participating states from Europe and Central Asia and has more than 20 offices in the region.
			<br><br>
			The aim of the organisation is to encourage cooperation on politico-military, economic and environmental, and human aspects between member states. The organisation has made varies efforts in the areas such as policing strategies, counter-terrorism and economic and environmental activities.
			<br><br>
			OSCE hosts Prime Ministers/Presidents of its member states and OSCE delegates will be representing these individuals. The debate structure is ad-hoc, which means that delegates are not expected to prepare lengthy resolutions, but individually comprehensive clauses.
