		<h3>Committee Description</h3>
        <p>
          Remaining adamantly proud to have introduced the Historical Committee format to the Turkish MUN committee more than a decade ago, MUNDP is proud to present this years topic as The Deluge; The Deluge, or The Swedish Deluge, though obscure it may be in comparison to several other historical conflicts, is nevertheless one of the crucial pivot-points of European History. The name is ascribed to the Polish-Swedish War, where the Swedes, breaking a previously signed truce, invaded the Polish heartlands whilst the latter was preoccupied with numerous events of internal and external strife. In the five years of fighting that ensued, Poland lost a third of its population, along with its status as a Great Power of Europe.
          In simulating this legendary confrontation between these two military juggernauts, the Delegates will pledge their allegiances either to the Polish-Liuthanian Commonwealth, or to the Avaricious Swedish Crown, allied with the Muscovite Tsardom, whose will is to shatter the proud and vehement Commonwealth, to share its spoils amidst their own.
