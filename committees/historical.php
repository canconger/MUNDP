		<h3>Committee Description</h3>
    <p>
      After over a decade of proudly hosting The Historical Committee, MUNDP 2020 presents The Second Crusade, the battle of the Crusader States led by France and German kings, and the Levantine States led by the Seljuk Empire. The Second Crusade took place between the year 1147 to 1149 and it was one of the major wars in the 12th century.
			<br><br>
      The Second Crusade was initiated when the County of Edessa, founded during the First Crusade, was seized by the forces of Zengi, a Turkish atabeg who ruled many regions in the Middle East, in 1144.
      <br><br>
      After the fall of the County of Edessa, Pope Eugene III announced the Second Crusade, which became the first crusade to be led by European kings: Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany. With the help of other European Nobles, after crossing the Byzantine territory, the separated armies of the Crusaders were both defeated by Seljuk Turks. The Crusaders also lost their territory in Jerusalem after an ill-advised attack in 1148, which gave rise to the Third Crusade at the end of the 12th century.
