		<h3>Committee Description</h3>
    <p>
			The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is one of the most influential international bodies that has ever come into existence as it is the only binding UN organ. The UNSC consists of fifteen members in total five of which (France, People’s Republic of China, Russian Federation, United Kingdom, and the United States of America) are permanent members; the five permanent members posses the veto power and the other ten members are temporary and change every two years. The attendees must be knowledgeable and experienced to debate in the ad hoc format that the UNSC follows.
			<br><br>
			The Security Council has been conducting regular briefs when it comes to regional conflicts such as South Sudan and Ethiopia. Resolutions and consultations regarding famine, deployment and future requirements of the Regional Protection Force (RPF) as well as  impediments to the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) in carrying out its mandate have been ongoing. In the recent African Union summit, The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres announced that ties and communication between the African Union and the Security Council have been stronger than  subsequent years. In April of 2017, which landmarked the first UN-AU conference, two vital frameworks were established on peace and security and sustainable development. The UNSC, continues to have regular meetings regarding the recent establishments and Africa’s peace and security.
