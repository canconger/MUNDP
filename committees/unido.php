		<h3>Committee Description</h3>
    <p>
      United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), established in 8th of April 1979, is a UN Organisation primarily associated with Sustainable Development Goal 9, Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, and is dedicated to promote and accelerate inclusive and sustainable industrial development (ISID) in the Member States.
			<br><br>
      The Organisation has four focal points being creating shared prosperity, advancing economic competitiveness, safeguarding the environment and strengthening knowledge and institutions. As of May 2018, 168 States are members of UNIDO.
      <br><br>
      UNIDO has a regional office in Cairo and numerous country offices in the region. Several countries in the Arab State region have recently suffered a severe setback not only as a result of the global financial crisis but of internal conflicts ranging from civil unrest to revolution, triggered by unequal access to economic opportunities and social welfare as well as unemployment among young people. Therefore, the presence of UNIDO is fundamental to the stability of the economy of the Arab States.
