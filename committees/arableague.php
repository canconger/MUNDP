		<h3>Committee Description</h3>
    <p>
      The Arab League, or the League of Arab States, aims to unite the vastly differing Arab States in and around North Africa, the Horn of Africa and Arabia since its establishment in Cairo, 1945. As guided by the Charter of the Arab League, the agency works towards facilitating communication and coordinating collaboration between its Member States.
			<br><br>
      Even though the Arab League is regarded as a regional organization of Arab States, its efforts on free trade, economic cooperation, and joint defense have global and perpetual outcomes. Through its specialized institutions and Council, the Arab League establishes cultural, political, economic programs for the advancement of the Arab world. With the contributions of its 22 members and 4 observers, the Arab League has a substantial impact on some of our timeâ€™s most crucial issues such as the Qatari Blockade, the Syrian Civil War and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.
		</p>

		<h3>Agenda</h3>
		<p>
      Developing guidelines to diminish the consequences of economic sanctions and their impact on human rights
      <br><br>
      Achieving a peaceful and democratic political transition in Syria
      <br><br>
      Taking political measures to resolve the Libyan conflict
