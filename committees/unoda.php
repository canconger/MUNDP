		<h3>Committee Description</h3>
      <p>
      Established in January 1998 the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) promotes disarmament through dialogue confidence-building on military matters and regional disarmament efforts. The Office for Disarmament Affairs also supports multilateral efforts aimed at achieving the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.
			<br><br>
      UNODA actively works with other UN bodies such as the General Assembly First Committee and Disarmament Commission also heading various projects concerning the Arab States.
      <br><br>
      The office also is concerned with issues such as weapons of mass destruction, counter-terrorism strategy, gender perspectives, and disarmament education, which are all major issues in the Arab States. The office also publishes and promotes numerous treaties on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, cluster munitions, biological and chemical weapons, terrorism and arms trade. Since the Arab States such as Algeria, Jordan, Iraq, and Syria have been part of these treaties, the presence of UNODA and its programs is crucial to help stabilize the region and keep it from further conflicts.
